# 🪙 Crypto Tracker

A sleek, modern crypto dashboard with animated coin tickers, interactive price charts, and stylish UI—built in React and Material UI.

While the backend (for CoinGecko API access) was started, this project’s main focus is **front-end design, UI/UX innovation, and responsive crypto visualization.**

## 🖥️ Getting Started

> **Note:**  
> The backend for this project (to fetch live data from CoinGecko) was partially built, but due to API limitations, development pivoted to focus on front-end prototyping and UX.

**To run the UI and see all main features:**

1. Open a terminal and `cd` into the `frontend` folder.
2. Run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm start
3. Open  http://localhost:3000 to view the app in your browser.

You’ll see a variety of demo coins, price cards, and interactive charts—showcasing the design and mechanics of what I envisioned for the project!

## Tech Stack
React (with hooks and router)

Material UI (MUI components, icons, theming)

Nivo (interactive charting)

SVG / CSS (for animation and background)

## Future Plans
Reactivate and secure the backend for live API data

User portfolios and real-time alerts

More advanced analytics and chart features

Mobile-first improvements

## Inspired by classic tickers and modern dashboard aesthetics

Built with open source tools: CoinGecko API, Material UI, Nivo Charts, and Haikei for SVG waves.
